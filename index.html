              The Motherland MonumentÂ is one of the most prominent symbols of
              Ukraine's capital. The monument is one of the top 20 tallest
              statues in the world and thus deserves to be seen. From here, you
              can get a bird's-eye view of Kyiv. Viewing platforms aid in this:
              one is located on the pedestal's and the sculpture's border (36
              meters), and the other is on the arm with the shield (91 meters).

              jutting out into the sky with two slender towers, is one of the
              most unusual and beautiful buildings in the Old Kyiv. Raised in
              untypical for Ukraine's capital Neo Gothic style, it significantly
              stands out against the background of other buildings at the city's
              downtown and inevitably amazes Kyiv's locals and guests.

              Today, this area delights visitors with its low-rise houses from
              the last century, narrow streets, and unique atmosphere. Two
              ancient squares (Kontraktova and Postova), Kyiv-Mohyla Academy,
              Gostinny Dvir, Samson fountain, and the lower station of a rare

                Plan your visit ahead of time: what you want to see, what
                restaurants you want to try, and what else you want to do to
                treat yourself?

                Yes, you can plan not only traditional tourist activities, but
                also beautyÂ and health care! Prices in Ukraine are significantly
                lower than in other countries, but service (believe me) is far
                superior! It could be anything likeÂ stomatology,Â health checks,
                beautyÂ treatments, spa, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                At any time of year, you can find a variety of active sports and
                entertainment locations! You can find a place to visit by simply
                searching for something that interests you. If you're not sure

                The city has many parks and forest areas. Take a picnic or a

                Pay attention to walls of the buildings in Kyiv. You'll find

                Everyone says Kyiv is beautiful in the spring. The combination
                of blossoming chestnut trees and a cheerful atmosphere is
                wonderful. But winter in Kyiv is also worth seeing. St. Sophia
                Square will host the main Christmas Tree. The entire city will
                be enveloped in the warmth of the holiday season and mulled
                wine. In addition, there is a ski resort in the city.
